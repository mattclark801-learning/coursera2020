This program displays the frequency distributions of four variables on a group of people interviewed for the data set: 
   PPETHM: Race/Ethnicity 
   PPEDUCAT: Education (Categorical)
   W1_C1: Political Party
   W1_F6: Economic Optimism (for obtaining the American Dream)

Summary:


The data above are self explanatory and little outside of the header lines needs to be said that wasn’t remarked on in the week 1 assignment. The variable PPETHM surveyed Race/Ethnicity, where permitted responses were:  


1 White, Non-Hispanic 
2 Black, Non-Hispanic 
3 Other, Non-Hispanic 
4 Hispanic 
5 2+ Races, Non-Hispanic


The variable PPEDUCAT surveyed education level, categorically, allowing the following responses:


1 Less than high school
2 High school
3 Some college
4 Bachelor's degree or higher


The variable W1_C1 categorically measured political sympathies, asking “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent, or something else?” with the following responses allowed:


-1 Refused
1 Republican
2 Democrat
3 Independent
4 Something else, please specify


Finally, the variable W1_F6 indicates Economic Optimism, with responses to the question “How far along the road to your American Dream do you think you will ultimately get on a 10-point scale where 1 is not far at all and 10 nearly there?” allowed in these forms:


-1: Refused
1: Not Far
...
10: Nearly There
