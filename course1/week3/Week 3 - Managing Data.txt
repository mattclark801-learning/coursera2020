This program will displays 3 data managed variables as frequency distributions. The data management methods used herein will be variable collapsing and converting invalid numerical data to Numpy NaN values, and collapse categorical data fields yielding new insights.

Summary:
The data from my codebook don’t lend themselves particularly well to the methods demonstrated in the Week 3 videos and other resources. But in the spirit of demonstrating understanding of the concepts taught, I have performed some modifications to my data.


The Outlook On Life variable W1_C1 allowed the number -1 to indicate that a response was skipped. I’ve removed the -1 responses and replaced them with np.nans so that the data might yield itself to numerical analysis if that was desired.


The variables PPEDUCAT and W1_F6 survey respondents levels of education and economic optimism, categorically. I have reduced both of those variables to essentially binary yes/no questions: “Has the respondent at least a High School education?” And, “Is the respondent economically optimistic?”, showing the frequencies of both the original and condensed variables.


Additionally I’d like to mention that the sample code attached to these modules has been, without elaborating too much, I hope, difficult to work with. But it’s intended to be used by a person with no prior programming experience? I pity that person. Considering the cost of this course, it seems like it would take a small amount of work to bring the materials up to date.
